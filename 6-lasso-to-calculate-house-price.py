# Lasso is a function that use L1 Method of regularization. The ridge regression (previous lesson) apply the L2 Method of regularization.
# The regularization is used to give lower weight avoiding distortions

# Resume
# Linear Regression - It doesn't use any method of regularization
# Linear Regression + L2 Method Regularization = Ridge Regression
# Linear Regression + L1 Method Regulazization = Lasso
